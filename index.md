# Professional Summary
I'm a Ph.D. data scientist with deep expertise in **_time-series analysis, graph theory, and advanced machine learning_** for <ins>data-driven problem solving</ins>. I have 5+ years’ experience in developing end-to-end pipelines for translating multi-scale datasets into meaningful insights and actionable knowledge. I develop efficient approaches to solving complex, high-dimensional problems and deliver high-level and granular understanding of models’ behaviors. My work emphasizes cross-functional approaches based on computer vision, autoregressive modeling, and causal inference.

> **_I deliver creative solutions to pressing research problems, and I'm ready to contribute to a dynamic data-science work environment._**

# Research Skills
## High-dimensional & multi-modal data analysis
- In my Ph.D., I analyzed high-dimensional datasets of single cells' unique profiles from sparse `cell x gene` matrices with thousands of individual features and up to millions of unique observations:

> |         | G₁ | ⋯ | Gₘ |
> |---------|----|----|----|
> | C₁      | ⋱  | ⋯  | ⋰  |
> | ⋮       | ⋮  | ⋮  | ⋮  |
> | Cₙ      | ⋰  | ⋯  | ⋱  |

- These datasets often comprised multiple `cell x feature` matrices of cells' distinct biological properties

- To analyze these datasets, I used unsupervised machine-learning methods such as *t*-SNE and Louvain clustering:

## Deep learning for causal time-series analysis

- I developed the deep-learning method DELAY for reconstructing causal networks from single-cell datasets
- These datasets can reveal cells' relative maturity during processes like human brain development:

- Inspired by Granger Causality, I designed DELAY to encode noisy gene-expression data as images for computer vision

- DELAY uses a supervised neural network to classify images as either interacting or non-interacting gene pairs
