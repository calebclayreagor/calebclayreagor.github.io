## About me

I'm a graduate student in the lab of [A. James Hudspeth](https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/1186-a-james-hudspeth/) at Rockefeller University. I study the development, regeneration and evolution of highly-specialized sensory cells in the lateral line and inner ear using single cell genomics and dynamical systems theory.
