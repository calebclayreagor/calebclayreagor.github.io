# Professional Summary
I'm a Ph.D. data scientist with deep expertise in **_time-series analysis, graph theory, and advanced machine learning for data-driven problem solving_**. I have 5+ yearsâ€™ experience in developing end-to-end pipelines for translating large and small datasets into meaningful insights and actionable knowledge. I develop efficient approaches to solving complex, high-dimensional problems and deliver both big-picture and granular understanding of model behavior. My work emphasizes cross-functional approaches based on computer vision, autoregressive modeling, Bayesian statistics, and causal inference.
