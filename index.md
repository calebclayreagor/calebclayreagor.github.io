# Professional Summary
I'm a Ph.D. data scientist with deep expertise in **_time-series analysis, graph theory, and advanced machine learning_** for <ins>data-driven problem solving</ins>. I have 5+ years’ experience developing end-to-end pipelines for translating multi-scale datasets into meaningful insights and actionable knowledge. I focus on developing parsimonious solutions to complex, high-dimensional problems while delivering both granular and high-level understanding of models’ behaviors. My work emphasizes cross-functional approaches drawing on techniques from computer vision, autoregressive modeling, and causal inference.

**_I deliver creative solutions to pressing problems, and I'm ready to contribute to a dynamic data-science environment._**

# Research Competencies
## High-dimensional, multi-modal & multi-scale data analysis
In my Ph.D., I worked with high-dimensional biological datasets that describe cells' states or profiles as sparse `cell x gene` matrices:

> |         | G₁ | ⋯ | Gₘ |
> |---------|----|----|----|
> | C₁      | ⋱  | ⋯  | ⋰  |
> | ⋮       | ⋮  | ⋮  | ⋮  |
> | Cₙ      | ⋰  | ⋯  | ⋱  |

where $10^2<n<10^7$ and $10^3<m<10^6$.
